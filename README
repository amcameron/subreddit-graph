This is a project to generate a graph of connections between subreddits
by parsing their sidebar descriptions for links to other subreddits.
The idea is to be able to generate an interesting image at the end, and
start from an arbitrary list of subreddits.

This project contains work by Andrew Cameron and Jairaj Sethi, and was
inspired by a similar/identical project that Andrew's friend Harry wrote.
Thanks for the inspiration, Harry!  We are but implementers.
